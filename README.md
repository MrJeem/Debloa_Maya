# Debloa_Maya
This is a set of tools to make maya lighter by addressing common issues like unloading plugins and removing unnecessary lines of code from .ma, etc.


### Usage:

1. Put the "debloat_maya" folder in maya's scripts folder.
    (For example: C:\Users\<user_name>\Documents\maya\scripts)
2. Drop the mel file inside maya.
3. You will see all the currently installed plugins, the ones that are default and are loaded, and considered to have less use-case will be checked by default, you can uncheck them, or check more if you want.
4. Then press unload.
5. That is it! you have a clean Maya now.
